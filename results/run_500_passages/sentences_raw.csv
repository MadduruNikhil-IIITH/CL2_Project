P000294,P000294_S002,Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience.,1

P000296,P000296_S011,"Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and suggested that Aonuma consider using it.",1
P000297,P000297_S000,"Aonuma had anticipated creating a Zelda game for what would later be called the Wii, but had assumed that he would need to complete Twilight Princess first.",0
P000297,P000297_S001,"His team began work developing a pointing-based interface for the bow and arrow, and Aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel, just like the DS control scheme for Phantom Hourglass.",1
P000297,P000297_S002,"Aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed, but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a GameCube release.",0
P000297,P000297_S003,"Developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release, still disappointing the consumer.",1

P000299,P000299_S001,"A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint, but was unable to show the variety of Link's movements.",1
P000299,P000299_S002,"When the third-person view was restored, Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link's left hand, so the entire Wii version map was mirrored.",0
P000299,P000299_S003,"[p] Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication NGC Magazine claimed that when a GameCube copy of Twilight Princess was played on the Revolution, it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller.",1

P000300,P000300_S000,Nintendo staff members reported that demo users complained about the difficulty of the control scheme.,1
P000300,P000300_S001,"Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of ""forcing"" users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use.",0
P000300,P000300_S002,He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease.,1
P000300,P000300_S003,[q] The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses.,0
P000300,P000300_S004,"[r] In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword.",1
P000300,P000300_S005,"To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures—something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see.",1
P000300,P000300_S006,This reintroduced the problem of using a right-handed swing to control a left-handed sword attack.,1
P000300,P000300_S007,"The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game—everything was made a mirror image.",0
P000300,P000300_S008,"[s] Link was now right-handed, and references to ""east"" and ""west"" were switched around.",0

P000301,P000301_S004,Kondo's piece was later chosen as music for the E3 2005 trailer and for the demo movie after the game's title screen.,0
P000302,P000302_S000,"Media requests at the trade show prompted Kondo to consider using orchestral music for the other tracks in the game as well, a notion reinforced by his preference for live instruments.",1
P000302,P000302_S001,"He originally envisioned a full 50-person orchestra for action sequences and a string quartet for more ""lyrical moments"", though the final product used sequenced music instead.",1
