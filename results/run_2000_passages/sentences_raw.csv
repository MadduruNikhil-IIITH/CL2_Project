P000294,P000294_S002,Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience.,1

P000296,P000296_S011,"Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and suggested that Aonuma consider using it.",1
P000297,P000297_S000,"Aonuma had anticipated creating a Zelda game for what would later be called the Wii, but had assumed that he would need to complete Twilight Princess first.",0
P000297,P000297_S001,"His team began work developing a pointing-based interface for the bow and arrow, and Aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel, just like the DS control scheme for Phantom Hourglass.",1
P000297,P000297_S002,"Aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed, but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a GameCube release.",0
P000297,P000297_S003,"Developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release, still disappointing the consumer.",1

P000299,P000299_S001,"A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint, but was unable to show the variety of Link's movements.",1
P000299,P000299_S002,"When the third-person view was restored, Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link's left hand, so the entire Wii version map was mirrored.",0
P000299,P000299_S003,"[p] Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication NGC Magazine claimed that when a GameCube copy of Twilight Princess was played on the Revolution, it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller.",1

P000300,P000300_S000,Nintendo staff members reported that demo users complained about the difficulty of the control scheme.,1
P000300,P000300_S001,"Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of ""forcing"" users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use.",0
P000300,P000300_S002,He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease.,1
P000300,P000300_S003,[q] The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses.,0
P000300,P000300_S004,"[r] In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword.",1
P000300,P000300_S005,"To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures—something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see.",1
P000300,P000300_S006,This reintroduced the problem of using a right-handed swing to control a left-handed sword attack.,1
P000300,P000300_S007,"The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game—everything was made a mirror image.",0
P000300,P000300_S008,"[s] Link was now right-handed, and references to ""east"" and ""west"" were switched around.",0

P000301,P000301_S004,Kondo's piece was later chosen as music for the E3 2005 trailer and for the demo movie after the game's title screen.,0
P000302,P000302_S000,"Media requests at the trade show prompted Kondo to consider using orchestral music for the other tracks in the game as well, a notion reinforced by his preference for live instruments.",1
P000302,P000302_S001,"He originally envisioned a full 50-person orchestra for action sequences and a string quartet for more ""lyrical moments"", though the final product used sequenced music instead.",1

P001458,P001458_S000,One of the most spectacular examples of obligate mutualism is between the siboglinid tube worms and symbiotic bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.,0

P001459,P001459_S002,These cells affect the genetic composition of the host in order to regulate the increasing population of the endosymbionts and ensuring that these genetic changes are passed onto the offspring via vertical transmission (heredity).,1
P001460,P001460_S000,Adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host's lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont–the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size.,1

P001460,P001460_S002,"While important genes participating in the DNA to RNA transcription, protein translation and DNA/RNA replication are retained.",0
P001460,P001460_S003,"That is, a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter-genic regions or open reading frame (ORF) size.",0

P001460,P001460_S007,Muller's ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non-essential genes of the intracellular bacteria.,0
P001460,P001460_S008,This could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host.,1
P001461,P001461_S000,Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped.,1
P001461,P001461_S001,It is derived from the English word commensal used of human social interaction.,0

P001463,P001463_S005,"Depending on the definition used, as many as half of all animals have at least one parasitic phase in their life cycles, and it is also frequent in plants and fungi.",1

P001463,P001463_S007,An example of a biotrophic relationship would be a tick feeding on the blood of its host.,1
P001464,P001464_S000,Amensalism is the type of relationship that exists where one species is inhibited or completely obliterated and one is unaffected.,1

P001464,P001464_S004,Antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion.,0
P001464,P001464_S005,An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree.,0
P001464,P001464_S006,"The mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients.",0
P001464,P001464_S007,Throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected.,0
P001464,P001464_S008,"Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling.",0
P001464,P001464_S009,"Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism.",0
P001464,P001464_S010,"[citation needed] An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone.",1
P001465,P001465_S000,Amensalism is an interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by the other.,1
P001465,P001465_S001,A clear case of amensalism is where sheep or cattle trample grass.,0
P001465,P001465_S002,"Whilst the presence of the grass causes negligible detrimental effects to the animal's hoof, the grass suffers from being crushed.",0

P001465,P001465_S004,"Whilst the presence of the weevil has almost no influence on food availability, the presence of ibex has an enormous detrimental effect on weevil numbers, as they consume significant quantities of plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon it.",0
P001466,P001466_S000,Synnecrosis is a rare type of symbiosis in which the interaction between species is detrimental to both organisms involved.,1
P001466,P001466_S001,"It is a short-lived condition, as the interaction eventually causes death.",1
P001466,P001466_S002,"Because of this, evolution selects against synnecrosis and it is uncommon in nature.",1
P001466,P001466_S003,An example of this is the relationship between some species of bees and victims of the bee sting.,0
P001466,P001466_S004,Species of bees who die after stinging their prey inflict pain on themselves (albeit to protect the hive) as well as on the victim.,1

P001467,P001467_S000,"While historically, symbiosis has received less attention than other interactions such as predation or competition, it is increasingly recognized as an important selective force behind evolution, with many species having a long history of interdependent co-evolution.",0
P001467,P001467_S001,"In fact, the evolution of all eukaryotes (plants, animals, fungi, and protists) is believed under the endosymbiotic theory to have resulted from a symbiosis between various sorts of bacteria.",1
